Organizer App for Android

We have designed and built an android application which is capable of taking all manner of notes and getting things done. The app is able to write checklists, make reminders and more. The app intends to give a quick and simple editing experience when user organizes. We hope that organizing the notes and planning daily with our app is easier than any other organizer app.

All three features are presented in three different fragments which are navigated through navigation drawer. Each section has a ListView layout. SQLite DBAdapter class is used for maintaining SQLite database. Floating Action Button is used for primary action, i.e adding items to the notes, checklists and reminders.
